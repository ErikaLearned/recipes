#Bulk Taco Seasoning

Slightly modified from: www.foodrenegade.com/homemade-taco-seasoning/
(I didn't have red pepper flakes the first time I made it and have continued 
to not add any ever since)

    1/4 C. plus 1 Tbsp. Chili Powder
    1 1/4 tsp. Garlic Powder
    1 1/4 tsp. Onion Powder
    1 1/4 tsp. Dried Oregano
    2 1/2 tsp. Paprika
    2 Tbsp. plus 1 1/2 tsp. Ground Cumin
    1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Sea Salt
    1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. Black Pepper
	
Add to taste to meat and other dishes.
(I use this mix primarily on beans and rice mixed with corn.)
